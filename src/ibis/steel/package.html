This package contains a number of stochastic estimators.
That is, given a series of samples, each estimator produces a prediction for the next
value in the series. Every time a new sample is added, the estimate is updated. The estimators differ in the assumed distribution of the samples:
the <em>model</em>.
</p>
<p>
The {@link GaussianEstimator} assumes that the samples have a Gaussian distribution, which is a very common assumption,
although in some cases it produces inaccurate estimates.
The {@link ExponentialDecayEstimator] is similar, but places more weight on more recent samples, and is therefore more accurate
when the stochastic properties of the samples change over time.
The {@link LogGaussianEstimator} assumes that the <em>logarithms</em> of the samples have a Guassian distribution.
In some situations, for example for estimating network transmission times, this is a more realistic estimator, since it accurately models
that such transmission times are rarely much faster than the average, but that that
significantly slower transmission times are likely to occur now and then.
The {@link ExponentialDecayLogEstimator} is similar, but again places more weight on recent samples.
All estimators implement the Java interface {@link Estimator}, allowing the userto abstract away from the
exact prediction model of a particular estimate.
</p>
<p>
All estimators have constructors that require an initial value for the internal parameters of their model.
Although it is burdensome to demand such initial values from the user, the alternative (fixed initial parameters)
is even worse: in some cases such fixed initial parameters can be so far off that it renders the estimator virtually useless.
</p>
<p>
Although the internal parameters of the models can be reached, the estimators are designed to produce <em>estimates</em>
that are essentially snapshots of the estimator state, and that can produce a random value that is an as accurate as possible
prediction of the next value of the parameter.
These estimates can be manipulated by adding (stochastically independent) other estimates, and multiplying the estimate with a constant
value. This allows the construction of compound estimates from various simpler estimates.
To allow more complicated compound estimates, we also provides a {@link ConstantEstimate} that simply represents a constant
value as an estimate that can be added and multipled.
Similarly, the {\link InfiniteEstimate} represents an infinite value.
