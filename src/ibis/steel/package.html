This package contains a number of stochastic estimators.  That is, given
a series of samples, each estimator produces a prediction for the next
value in the series. Every time a new sample is added, the estimate is
updated. The estimator classes differ in the stochastic distribution that they
assume for the
samples: in other words, each class has its own <em>model</em>.
</p>
<p>
The {@link ibis.steel.GaussianEstimator} assumes that the samples have a Gaussian
distribution (lso known as the <em>normal</em> distribution).
The {@link ibis.steel.GuassianDecayingEstimator}
is similar, but places more weight on more recent samples, and is
therefore more accurate when the stochastic properties of the samples
change over time.  The {@link ibis.steel.LogGaussianEstimator} assumes that
the <em>logarithms</em> of the samples have a Guassian distribution.
In some situations, for example for estimating network transmission
times, this is a more realistic estimator, since it accurately models
that such transmission times are rarely much faster than the average,
but that significantly slower transmission times are likely to occur
now and then.  The {@link ibis.steel.LogGaussianDecayingEstimator} is similar, but
again places more weight on recent samples.  All estimators implement
the Java interface {@link ibis.steel.Estimator}, allowing the user to abstract away
from the exact stochastic model of a particular estimate.
</p>
<p>
All constructors of the estimators require an initial value for the
internal parameters of their model.  Although it is burdensome to
demand such initial values from the user, the alternative (fixed initial
parameters) is even worse: in some cases such fixed initial parameters
can be so far off that it renders the estimator virtually useless.
</p>
<p>
Although the internal parameters of the models are accessible, the estimators are designed to produce <em>estimates</em>
that are essentially snapshots of the estimator state, and that can be stored, transmitted to other machines,
added to other estimates, and multiplied by constant values.
An estimate can produce a random value that is an as accurate as possible
prediction of the next value of the parameter.
To allow more complex compound estimates, we also provide a {@link ibis.steel.ConstantEstimate} that simply represents a constant
value as an estimate that can be added and multiplied.
Similarly, the {@link ibis.steel.InfiniteEstimate} represents an infinite value.
